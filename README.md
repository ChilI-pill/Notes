Arrow functions are a shorthand syntax for writing JavaScript functions.There are several reasons why arrow functions are commonly used:

Concise Syntax: Arrow functions have a shorter syntax compared to traditional function expressions. This makes the code more readable and easier to write. For example:

// Traditional function expression
const square = function(x) {
  return x * x;
};

// Arrow function
const square = x => x * x;

Lexical this: Arrow functions have a lexical this binding, which means that this refers to the surrounding scope. This is in contrast to traditional functions, where this is dynamically scoped and can change depending on how the function is called.

Better for Callbacks: Arrow functions are often used as callbacks, for example in event handlers or when working with arrays. For example:

// Using a traditional function
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map(function(n) {
  return n * 2;
});

// Using an arrow function
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2);
